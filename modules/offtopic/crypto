ciphers do not involve meaning; codes are used to save time. ciphers are algorithms that are performed on small chunks of letters. 
ciphers operator on syntax while codes operate on semantics, meaning, a code is stored as a mapping in a code book, while ciphers transform individual symbols according to an algorithm

Shift Cipher

Cipher is an algorithm
the algorithm is a key
Shared key is required to encrypt and decrypt

how to encrypt
for every letter in the message M:

Convert the letter into a number that matches its order in the alphabet starting from 0 and call this number X
Calculate Y=(X+k) mod 26
Convert the number Y into a letter tht matches its order in the alphabet starting from 0

How to Decrypt

convert the letter into a number thayt matches its order in the alphabet starting from 0 and call this number Y
calculate X=(Y-K) mod 26
Convert the number X into a letter that matches its order in the alphabet starting from 0

AND is a logical conjuction and would produce a truth tables 
OR is logical disjuctions ; it outputs 1 whenever 1 or more of its ouputs are 1
XOR only outputs 1 whenever the inputs do not match, which occurs when one of the two inputs is exclusively true 


AND has a 75% change of outputting a 0 and 25 % chance of outputing a 1
while Or has a 25 percent change of outputting a 0 and 75 percent chance of outputing a 1 while XOR has a 50% chace of outputting 0 or 1


1010 XOR 1100 - 0110

(x xor y) xor (y xor z)

x=001
y=010
z=100

001 xor 010 = 011

010 xor 100 = 110

011 110 101

11010 and  01001

0100

checked into room 250 for 3 days and they gave you a copy of the key
you receive an encrypted message; message space vs key space , cipher text space   
a perfect secret has the same size message space, as the key space, and the ciphertext space

04072018 - In order to get it to work, I had figure out how to which shift was using by using a simple brute force attack; then I unencrypted the first part of the post it note and found a few new words 
next step is to break the information below into delimited words with posibbile dictionary mappings

we can generate random numbers by measuring noise  - non deterministics 

seed can be truly random; middle square method
the length before the psuedorandom sequence repeats is called the period
seed space; must be impractile for a computer to try all seeds 

a



what is possible vs what is possible in a reasonalble amount
the security increases 

alogorithms, that operate on individual of chunks of letters; it needs one piece of information called a key

distribution of letter frequencies 
1. determine the length of the shift word used
2. check the frequency distribution of different intervals 


convert the letters to numbers 

for example "snake" > 





making guess and ruling them out is a part of the learning process and it very important to science

 
people will always be iangry with you when you leave but if you a traveler, just make sure people know that about you up front. The gospel was spread by travelers. As a traveler, I am constantly in the air, on the road, on the rails, on my feet, I am a man of constant study. I measure time and space for living, i decipher codes and unlock meaning in cryptography as well as the scripture not restricted to a particular religion; book genre movie or song. I fight for truth and hope; each day I remember how I could have been on the other side of things and I thank God, I listened and that he had touched me in such a way that I would


one-time pad - means to create a randome number key as long as the message and it was developed in the 19th centery

The trick is to count sequences - frequency stability

the key setting is the intial configuration of the machine that generates random numbers rotor encryption machine

rotor encryption machines works by having three rotor and generating a shift based on the sum of the three rotors 

key space -> increase if the numbe of way; where choose and initial rotor ordering, then then we choose a configuration

******a God is a character sequence the represents a person contextual stories, their positives and negatives

September 1 1945; Perfect secrecy is defined as leaving zero information about your choice and no one can do anything better than a guess

message space - a complete list of all possible 
shared key   - random generated space
key space   - cypher text space 

The size of the message space equals the size of the message space equal the size of the ciphertext space

currently I am working in the shift1.py file; 

need to install some software that will allow me to plot the list contents so I can see the distribution frequency of the letters;i


$ sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib

Use 'sudo apt autoremove' to remove them.


if you calculate the letter frequencies 
anytime there is a differential in letter frequency ; this difference is caused by repetition in the encrypted message ;
to break the encryption, determine the length of the shiftword used , not the word itself ; check the frequency distribution of different intervales 

I learned to create a bar chart 
current file being used is :sample.bar.chart.py
